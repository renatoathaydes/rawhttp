# RawHTTP Core Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2023-08-26

### Added

- `except` method to `RawHttpHeaders` to copy headers except for named ones.
- `size` method to `RawHttpHeaders`.
- `isSuccess` and static `isSuccessCode` to `StatusLine`.
- `tunnel` method to `Router` interface to support tunneling on `CONNECT` requests.
- `allowContentLengthMismatch` to `RawHttpOptions` and `RawHttpOptions.Builder`,
   so if a content-length body ends early, it is returned anyway instead of throwing an Exception.
- `allowIllegalConnectAuthority` to `RawHttpOptions` and `RawHttpOptions.Builder`.

### Changed

- `RawHttp#responseHasBody` used to mistakenly return `false` for `CONNECT` requests.
   This check has been removed because `CONNECT` requests still require a response
   which is allowed to have a body (though it shouldn't).
- `RequestLine` now forbids `CONNECT` requests missing a host or port. Previously, this was just
   an `assert`. To disable this check, use `allowIllegalConnectAuthority`.
- `RawHttpResponse#shouldCloseConnectionAfter` no longer returns `true` for responses that are not
   allowed to have a body when framing information is missing (as it is supposed to be the case).

## [2.5.2] - 2022-12-23

### Changed
