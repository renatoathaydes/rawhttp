# RawHTTP http-components

> WARNING: this module is not currently published to Maven Central.
> Use it for reference only.

RawHTTP can be integrated with the popular
[HttpComponents library's](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/) HTTP client.

This can be useful if you need to use features from a more complete HTTP client, such as cookie
administration and automatic redirects, but prefer to use the simpler API provided by RawHTTP.
